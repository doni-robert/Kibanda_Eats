          <h4>About</h4>
          <p>
            Kibanda Eats was inspired by the tough economic times and an ever-increasing need for affordable 
            sustenance. It all began with a humble desire to connect people through a shared love for food and 
            a search for wallet-friendly dining options.
            As I walked through the bustling streets of my hometown, I couldn't help but notice the resilient spirit of 
            local eateries. They served mouthwatering dishes crafted with passion and care, often at prices that didn't 
            break the bank. It was a testament to the unwavering determination of communities to provide for one another 
            during challenging times.
            <br>
            Then why not create an app that allowed people to share photos of these delectable local dishes, 
            along with the locations of these hidden gems, and their affordble prices. I wanted to celebrate the 
            heart and soul of these small businesses and help individuals discover affordable, delicious meals 
            nearby.
            <br>
            And so, Kibanda Eats was born - a platform that not only lets users tantalize their taste buds 
            through mouthwatering food photos but also supports local economies by connecting patrons to these 
            treasured establishments. It's a testament to the resilience of communities and a celebration of the 
            joy that can be found in a shared meal, even in the toughest of times.
